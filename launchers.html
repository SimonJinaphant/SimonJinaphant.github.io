									<br/>
									To give engineering students hand’s on experience, first years students taking APSC 150 must work in a team to
									design, construct, and present a projectile launcher; due to the evolving nature of this course, 
									students enrolled in the second term of the 2014 winter sessions were specifically required 
									to have their launcher shoot multiple payloads into four different marked targets.
									<br/><br/>
									Students are divided into groups of eight and were given <i>almost</i> free creativity over the design, 
									which they must completed within the next five weeks. Each groups were required to design two launchers and pick one for 
									competition based on their preference from testing.

								<p>
									The requirements for the launcher included a joystick, linked to an Arduino, which is used to control a maximum of three servos; 
									these servos are used to adjust the launcher’s pitch and yaw angle, along with releasing the trigger to shoot the payload.
									<br/><br/>
									The circuitry for controlling all three servos, along with the software, were provided and encouraged to be modified.

								<p>
									I was responsible for understanding the circuitry and software, 
									along with adjusting them to allow extra flexibility in our design options.
									<br/><br/>
									During the design weeks many teams had to work outside of the given lab time; 
									I had to ensure participation and cooperation between my fellow team members by managing team 
									communication and establishing meetings outside of class time.

								<p>
									Together with my group, we proposed two design models and split into two separate sub-teams to begin work. 
									<br/><br/>
									The first proposed design, used all of the three servos provided in order to control the trigger, pitch, and yaw angles. 
									<br/><br/>
									Due to its freedom of controlling the angles, this launcher was codename <i>Limitless</i>.
								</p>

							<article class="6u 12u$(xsmall) work-item">
								<p>							
									The second launcher, which I worked on, was designed to be unique compared to all of the rest.
									<br/><br/>
									Instead of using all three servos to have more flexibility, we physically restricted the pitch angle of the launcher 
									and only used two servos -one for the trigger and the other to adjust the yaw angle.
									<br/><br/>
									To complement the first design’s codename, I named this launcher <i>Limited Edition</i>.

								<h4>A sample design schematic for <i>Limited Edition</i></h4>

							<article class="12u$ 12u$(xsmall) work-item">
								<p>
									In order for <i>Limited Edition</i> to be capable of shooting at all four targets, we needed a new way of adjusting the launcher’s firing range. 
									Since we cannot adjust the pitch angle we were forced to adjust the tension from the rubber bands. 
									The design for this included a <i>“tension selector”</i> which essentially provided a way to hook the rubber band at 
									three different locations for different tension strengths.

								<h4>The resulting launchers: <i>Limited Edition</i> on the left, and <i>Limitless</i> on the right</h4>
								<p>
									<br/>
									For the competition we selected <i>Limitless</i> over <i>Limited Edition</i>, the primary reason was due to the reloading speed. 
									While <i>Limited Edition</i> provided a unique way to launch the payload, reloading it via the <i>"tension selector"</i> 
									was difficult and time consuming. 
									<br/><br/>
									Our choice to focus on the reloading speed eventually paid off during competition. We scored 4 out of 8 points which 
									ranked us amongst the top teams, whereas many other teams had difficulties reloading thus making them run out of time.
