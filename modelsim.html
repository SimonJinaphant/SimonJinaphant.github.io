									3D computer graphics was one of the topics that captivated me into studying computers science; 
									as part of a long-term learning process I established a future goal for myself to develop an 
									application which utilizes popular graphics frameworks such as OpenGL.

								<p>
									The OpenGL API provides high performance manipulation of computer graphics; 
									it harness the physical Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) to deliver computational power for 
									repetitive but demanding tasks, in which a CPU wasn't designed to handle effectively such as video rendering.
									<br/><br/>
									Development with OpenGL uses the modern pipeline allowing software developers to have more control 
									on how an image is rendered through the usage of shaders. The pipeline operates in a sequential manner, 
									starting from the vertex transformations via the vertex shader, to determining how each pixel should be 
									colored and blended after the fragment shader.
									<br/></br/>
									OpenGL is also popular as it has been ported to other different platforms; 
									it can be used for embedded systems such as mobile phones or tablets via OpenGL-ES, 
									or on web based systems with WebGL. It should be noted that these variations do not offer a 
									complete coverage of the original API but still contains the fundamental packages.

								<p>
									This project took longer to complete than expected, I originally started the project in April of 2015; 
									the project was initially written in Java and uses the LWJGL library to provide an OpenGL context. 
									My learning resources were primarily based on a couple of video tutorials however as I further moved 
									through the tutorials I realized that I wasn't really learning much and the provided code became more 
									and more confusing, thus making the project come to a halt. 
									<br/><br/>
									During the summer I stumbled upon online book on OpenGL, and it prompted me to restart the project again. 
									At this time I was also starting the development on this website which influenced me to attempt creating 
									a javascript application which could be hosted online here, so I decided I would try to use the OpenGL 
									tutorial but write the application with WebGL.
