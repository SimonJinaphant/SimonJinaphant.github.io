							<h1>HELLO, MY NAME IS SIMON JINAPHANT</h1>
						</header>
						<p>
							I am a <strong>2nd Year Computer Engineering Student</strong> fascinated by the potentials of both hardware and software systems, 
							along with their capabilities to deliver solutions for today’s problems. I am particularly interested in ...


							<br/><br/>Teamwork is an important aspect I recognize, especially when working on large-scale projects;
							in my free times I collaborate with other dedicated students to develop <a href="http://www.snowbots.ca/">autonomous vehicles</a> 
							which competes against other teams from around the world!

							<br/><br/>I also enjoy learning by doing, as demonstrated by some of my personal projects which includes 
							an Android application that solves complex maze and a 3D graphics engine that uses OpenGL for hardware acceleration.

							<h2><a href="http://www.snowbots.ca/">UBC SNOWBOTS</a> | SEPT 2014 - PRESENT</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
							I am a proud member of UBC Snowbots, a student team dedicated to the research and development of autonomous ground vehicles. 
							I was one of eight members selected to attend competition, where we ranked 4th in design and 5th in networking, 
							against 40 other registered teams from around the world.
							<br/><br/>
							I collaborate with the AI team to develop the core software systems for autonomous navigation; 
							currently I am leading the design for the pathfinding system, which allows the vehicle to compute 
							the shortest route to travel in a 200 ft by 100 ft obstacle course.
							<br/><br/>
							Technologies used: C++, ROS, OpenCV, Linux, Git

							<header>
								<h3>Computer Science Department Assistant</h3>
								<h4>Eric Hamber Secondary | Sept 2013 - June 2014</h4>
							</header>
							<p>
								During my final year of high school, I had helped enrich the computer science program for over 120 students, 
								in addition to any future students who will be enrolled after I have graduated.
								<ul>
									<li>
										Produced multiple online resources for junior students, allowing them to have convenient access anywhere; 
										this also lead to a significant 20% increase in the year’s test results.
									</li>
									<li>
										Developed a program which interacts with the student’s virtual robots and process the simulated battle results, 
										resulting in a new annual competition for students to participate in.
									</li>
									<li>
										Created a <a href="http://erichamber.ca/departments/compsci/">visually appealing webpage</a> 
										which highlights student's accomplishments and interest for computer science, 
										further promoting the program to parents and prospective students.
									</li>
