							<h1>MY NAME IS SIMON JINAPHANT</h1>
						</header>
						<p>
							I am a Computer Engineering student fascinated by both hardware and software systems, 
							along with their capabilities to deliver solutions for today’s problems. 
							During my free time I enjoy learning more about my interests and demonstrating my understanding through projects.
							
							<br/><br/>
							Teamwork is an important aspect I recognize, especially when working on large-scale projects;
							I collaborate with other dedicated students to develop <a href="#teams">autonomous vehicles</a> 
							which will compete against other teams from around the world!

							<br/><br/>
							I also have prior experience developing software for mobile and desktop, 
							as demonstrated by some of my <a href="#projects">personal projects</a>. These projects include 
							an Android application that solves complex maze, along with a 3D graphics engine that uses OpenGL 
							for hardware acceleration.

							<h4>MEMBER SINCE SEPTEMBER 2014</h4>
						</header>
						<p>
							I am a proud member of UBC Snowbots, a student team dedicated to the research and development of autonomous ground vehicles. 
							I was one of eight members selected to attend competition, where we ranked 4th in design and 5th in networking, 
							against 40 other registered teams from around the world.
							<br/><br/>
							I am currently leading the design for the pathfinding system; 
							this system allows the vehicle to compute the shortest route in order to autonomously navigate a 200 ft by 100 ft obstacle course.
							<br/><br/>
							My past accomplishments included optimizing the camera capturing software to increase performance by 4x in best case scenarios,
							along with resolving memory leaks and serial connection issues to increase productivity time by 20%.
							<br/><br/>
							Technologies used: C++, ROS, OpenCV, Linux, Git

						<article class="resume">
							<header>
								<h3>Computer Science Department Assistant</h3>
								<h4>Eric Hamber Secondary | Sept 2013 - June 2014</h4>
							</header>
							<p>
								During my final year of high school, I had helped enrich the computer science program for over 120 students, 
								in addition to any future students who will be enrolled after I have graduated.
								<ul class="indent">
									<li>
										Produced multiple online resources for junior students, allowing them to have convenient access anywhere; 
										this also lead to a significant 20% increase in the year’s test results.
									</li>
									<li>
										Developed a program to interact with virtual robots students create by recording the simulated battle between them, 
										resulting in a new annual competition for students to participate in.
									</li>
									<li>
										Created a <a href="http://erichamber.ca/departments/compsci/">visually appealing webpage</a> 
										which highlights student's accomplishments and interest for computer science, 
										further promoting the program to parents and prospective students.
