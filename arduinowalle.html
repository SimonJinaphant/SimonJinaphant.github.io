								<h4>An overview image of our team's robot</h4>
								<p>
									This project showcase the various skills learned in the labs of ELEC 291, a second year project design course.
									Students must work in a group of six to implement a multi-functional robot using an Arduino, a 2 wheel drive mobile platform, and various sensors.
									The robot will have two principle functionalities defined by the instructor and one
									additional functionality left open to be creatively defined and implemented by the students.

									<h3>Autonomous Mode</h3>
									<ul>
										<li>The robot must gradually slow down once it detects an object nearby</li>
										<li>The robot must come to a complete stop when within a close distance of the object</li>
										<li>The robot turns 90 degrees left or right to escape the object</li>
									</ul>
									<h3>Line Following Mode</h3>
									<ul>
										<li>The robot must use an optical sensors to guide itself along a marked path on the ground</li>
										<li>The path is a line that is darker than the background</li>
									</ul>
									<h3>Bluetooth Mode</h3>
									<ul>
										<li>The robot operates through human inputs from a Bluetooth enabled controller</li>
										<li>The robot can also do special movements from a specific input</li>
									</ul>

								<h1 class="uppercase"><span class="icon fa-gears"></span> Autonomous Movements</h1>
								<p>
									The hardware for autonomous mode includes the ultrasonic range finder and a servo motor.
									The range finder is attached to a small breadboard which is glued onto the
									servo's rotating arm.
									<br/><br/>
									The robot moves forward until it detects an object with the range finder and gradually
									slows down in order to adjust itself in time to avoid a collision.

									Once it is stationary, the servo would rotate the ultrasonic range finder so it canvas
									take in a 180 degree field-of-view scan and decide whether to turn left or right based
									on which side returned a longer distance.

								<h1 class="uppercase"><span class="icon fa-gears"></span> Line Follower</h1>
								<p>
									The primary sensor used for Line Following is the reflective optical sensor; this sensor
									allows the arduino to distinct between light and dark images through infra-red scanning;
									for this we require the line to follow be a different color from the color of
									the floor.
									<br/><br/>
									The robot is set to move at a predefined speed; this speed was determined through several trials
									where the robot slowly accelerate and we monitor the speed until it goes off the line due to being
									too fast for the motors to react in time.

								<h1 class="uppercase"><span class="icon fa-gears"></span> Bluetooth Communication</h1>
								<p>
									For our team's additional functionality we chose to implement remote user interface/
									control functionality via Bluetooth.
									Smartphones are ubiquitous these days which makes them an ideal bluetooth controller.
									We also added Voice Recognition capabilities via Google's Speech API to increase accessibility
									and the coolness factor.
									<br/><br/>
									Using a HC-06 bluetooth module, we connected the robot to an Android mobile
									app that has a GUI for changing between the various modes: Line Following, autonomous, and manual control model.
									We used the Google Speech API to set predefined voice commands which would trigger certain actions of the robot,
									however we later dropped the feature because due to criteria demands.
									<br/><br/>
									Alternatively, we leveraged the phone’s internal gyroscope sensor to add tilt motion for moving, and a shake motion
									to make the robot wiggle in place. To continue with the Rapid Prototyping spirit of the Arduino platform,
									MIT App Inventor (http://appinventor.mit.edu) was used to develop the Android app that served
									as the remote user interface to control the robot. This tool allowed for incredibly fast
									development without wasting time with the details of Android app Development.
									Though the interface/creation process may seem simplistic, one can create complex and
									powerful apps with minimal limitations.
									<br/><br/>
									The Bluetooth module allowed for two-way serial communication over Pins 0 and 1.
									Command were sent over Serial input from phone to Arduino,
									and status data was sent from Arduino to phone.

								<p>
									In this project we combined all of our knowledge and skills gained from previous labs
									to create a multi-functional robot; we were able to use our knowledge of displays,
									various sensors, wiring practices, and soldering. We also learned how to use hall
									effect sensors, reflective optical sensors, and how to wire an Arduino to an external power source.
									<br/><br/>
									Our additional functionality was the ability to control our robot via a bluetooth connection.
									We would definitely recommend including the HC-06 bluetooth module in lab kits for future courses.
									It’s relatively cheap ($6) and offers a lot of freedom through its wireless capability.
