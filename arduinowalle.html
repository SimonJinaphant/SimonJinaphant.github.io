								<h4>An overview image of our team's robot</h4>
								<p>
									This project showcase the various skills learned in the labs of ELEC 291, a second year project design course.
									Students must work in a group of six to implement a multi-functional robot using an Arduino, a 2 wheel drive mobile platform, and various sensors.
									The robot will have two principle functionalities defined by the instructor and one
									additional functionality left open to be creatively defined and implemented by the students.

									<h3>Autonomous Mode</h3>
									<ul>
										<li>The robot must gradually slow down once it detects an object nearby</li>
										<li>The robot must come to a complete stop when within a close distance of the object</li>
										<li>The robot turns 90 degrees left or right to escape the object</li>
									</ul>
									<h3>Line Following Mode</h3>
									<ul>
										<li>The robot must use an optical sensors to guide itself along a marked path on the ground</li>
										<li>The path is a line that is darker than the background</li>
									</ul>
									<h3>Bluetooth Mode</h3>
									<ul>
										<li>The robot operates through human inputs from a Bluetooth enabled controller</li>
										<li>The robot can also do special movements from a specific input</li>
									</ul>

								<h1 class="uppercase"><span class="icon fa-gears"></span> Autonomous Movements</h1>
								<p>
									This part of the lab included integrating the
									ultrasonic range finder (HC-SR04), and servo with the robot.
									The robot moves forward until it detects an object with the
									ultrasonic range finder and gradually slows down in order to adjust itself in time to avoid a collision.
									Once it is stationary, the servo would rotate the ultrasonic range finder so it could take
									in data about its surroundings and decide whether
									to turn left or right based on which side returned a longer distance.

								<h1 class="uppercase"><span class="icon fa-gears"></span> Bluetooth Communication</h1>
								<p>
									This part of the lab was the additional functionality left for the team to freely implement;
									for this feature we chose to implement remote user interface/control functionality over Bluetooth.
									Smartphones are ubiquitous these days and so is bluetooth.
									<br/><br/>
									The combination provides the best possible user interface to the robot.
									We also added Voice Recognition to increase accessibility and the coolness factor.
									<br/><br/>
									Using an HC-06 bluetooth module, we connected the robot/Arduino to an Android mobile
									app that has a GUI for changing between Line Following, autonomous, and manual control model.
									We also used the Google Speech API  for predefined voice commands,
									but dropped the feature because the professor told us not to include any internet enabled applications.
									<br/><br/>
									Instead, we leveraged the phone’s internal gyroscope sensor to add tilt to move functionality
									and shake to wiggle functionality. To continue with the Rapid Prototyping spirit of the Arduino platform,
									MIT App Inventor (http://appinventor.mit.edu) was used to develop the Android app that served
									as the remote user interface to control the robot. This tool allowed for incredibly fast
									development without wasting time diving into the nitty gritty details of Android app Development.
									New features and functionality were added in seconds, therefore development time wasn’t a limiting factor.
									Though the interface/creation process may seem simplistic, one can create complex and
									powerful apps with minimal limitations.
									<br/><br/>
									The Bluetooth module allowed for two-way serial communication over Pins 0 and 1.
									Command were sent over Serial input from phone to Arduino,
									and status data was sent from Arduino to phone.

								<p>
									In this project we were able to culminate all our knowledge from the previous labs
									to create a multi-functional robot; we were able to use our knowledge of displays,
									various sensors, wiring practices, and soldering. We also learned how to use hall
									effect sensors, reflective optical sensors, and how to wire an Arduino to an external power source.
									Although there were some complications regarding the hall effect sensors, our robot was able to
									perform reasonably well most of the time.
									<br/><br/>
									Our additional functionality was the ability to control our robot via a bluetooth connection.
									Once integrated, it worked quite well with our robot, and effectively made the button obsolete.
									This freed up some pins, which we could have used for another component if we had some more time.
									<br/><br/>
									We would definitely recommend including the HC-06 bluetooth module in lab kits for future courses.
									It’s relatively cheap ($6) and offers a lot of freedom through its wireless capability.
