						<br/> During the summer before second year I began polishing my portfolio of small projects, hoping to acquire at-least one internship offer for the summer of 2016; never did I imagine that I would end up being apart of Microsoft Vancouver as a
						software engineering intern, especially for my first ever software internship!

					<p>
						The specific internship program I was apart of was Garage, which focuses on delivering large impact from small projects developed and designed from the ground up.
						<br/><br/> For the first week of the internship we were pitched various projects from different divisions/groups of Microsoft. Each project focused on different customers, technologies, and value; from building intelligent web bots to pioneering
						accessibility apps to help people access more of the world around them.

					<h1 class="uppercase"><span class="icon fa-gears"></span> Hearing AI</h1>
					<p>
						My team focused on building an application which pioneers the concept of visualization and translation of sound for the deaf and hard of hearing community.
						<br/><br/> The origins of this project branched off of another Microsoft hackathon project from 2015, when a woman with hearing loss was unaware that her carbon monoxide detector was ringing for almost 2 weeks; putting her in a dangerous situation.

						For ordinary people, sound is something taken for granted each day; sound provides contextual information -such as a sharp beeping noise provides an indication of distress in the environment- but this important information is not accessible to everyone.
						<br/><br/> Our project focused on the question “Why must sound only be heard?”. Through user research we learned that people who are deaf and hard of hearing rely a lot more on what they see. Our project aimed to compliment their prefered sense
						by translating the sound environment through visualization and transcription of speech -with a unique twist.

					<h1 class="uppercase"><span class="icon fa-bookmark"></span> The Experience</h1>
					<p>
						For my first software engineering internship this program has been both challenging and rewarding. I joined this internship program with one goal in mind: To work with a community of people and build upon ideas together; and it was definitely met. Despite
						being the only intern out of cohort who never had any previous software development experience, I still felt welcome to the community.
						<br/><br/> My top contributions to the project includes:
						<ul class="indent">
							<li>
								Increased team productivity with an automated distribution system used to deliver daily updates and improvements to over 45 early adopters.
							</li>
							<li>
								Established telemetry to gain insight on how customers use the app and how to improve their experience, leading to a weekly retention rate of 67%.
							</li>
							<li>
								Implemented a web service that registers and grants access to other services without jeopardizing private data on both communication endpoints.
							</li>
						</ul>
