								<h4>Project SentrINO: An Internet-of-Things enabled security system</h4>
								<p>
									is project showcase the various skills students learned in the labs of ELEC 291, a second year project design course.
									For this project, students in groups of six were free to choose what we created as long as it interacted with
									the internet and embodied the principles of "Internet of Things" technologies.
									<br/><br/>
									My group chose to implement a home security robot that behaves in response to its
									environment and be controlled over the internet; this was accomplished using a
									Raspberry Pi, Arduino, a USB webcam, and various sensors.

									<h3>Remote Access</h3>
									<ul>
										<li>Streams a camera feed over WiFi to a website from the USB webcam and Raspberry PI</li>
										<li>User can type messages on the website which will be relay
											to an audio speaker near the sentry using Text ­to ­Speech</li>
										<li>Remote manual control via keyboard arrow keys or on­screen buttons, adjusting pitch and yaw position</li>
									</ul>
									<h3>Sentry Mode: Autonomous Serveillance</h3>
									<ul>
										<li>Processes a live image feed from the webcam,
											differentiating friendlies from intruders by colour</li>
										<li>The sentry moves the webcam to follow the intruder if they are on the screend</li>
										<li>Detecting an intruder on the screen for more than two seconds raises the alarm</li>
									</ul>
									<h3>Sentry Mode: Alarm Mode</h3>
									<ul>
										<li>The Piezo buzzer rapidly beeps and the yellow LED is turns on</li>
										<li>Webcam starts video recording and stores it in a file server for future access</li>
										<li>The user receives a notification through SMS regarding the alarm raised</li>
										<li>Alarm can be disabled if the proper keycode is entered with the keypad</li>

								<h1 class="uppercase"><span class="icon fa-gears"></span> Hardware</h1>
								<p>
									In order to keep the wires organized, having the breadboards on the platform was essential
									since it had to be in close proximity to all of the hardware.
									As a result, the Pi had to be kept separate from the platform to free up space for the breadboards.
									However, this worked to our advantage because it allowed us to connect external devices
									such as a monitor and a keyboard to the Pi easily.
									<br/><br/>
									The Arduino was used to integrate all of the hardware components;
									this included a keypad, an LCD, an LED, a Piezo buzzer and servo motors.
									The Arduino was incompatible with other USB cables and audio plugs so the
									webcam and the speakers were connected directly to the Pi.
									As for other external devices, we had a keyboard and a monitor connected to the Pi
									so that we were able to program on the Pi.
									<br/><br/>
									We initially powered the Arduino from the Pi, but found that this causes
									issues with the communication between the two modules.
									Thus we had to give the Arduino its own power source from its DC power jack through an adapter;
									after this change, the system ran more smoothly.

								<h1 class="uppercase"><span class="icon fa-gears"></span> Image Processing</h1>
								<p>
										This part of the project included creating a video stream from the webcam,
										a server to host the web page, a listener script to listen for command from
										the remote interface and a file server to show saved webcam recordings.
										<br/><br/>
										The webpage has onscreen buttons and keyboard control which in turn control the Raspberry Pi,
										and by extension the Arduino (remote access). Furthermore, the user can send text messages
										from the website that is relayed to the speaker by text to speech.
										<br/><br/>
										The images are taken from the camera through OpenCV ­ an open source computer vision library.
										The processed video stream is then broken up into single JPEG frames.
										We used the Flask web framework to create an MJPEG stream;
										this stream can be embedded as any regular image on the web page
										except it automatically updates with new frames, in essence becoming a stream.
										<br/><br/>
										As with all livestreams, latency is an important factor to keep in mind.
										The latency was due to our wireless internet connection being a phone’s hotspot.
										Coupled with low transfer speeds around 50kb/s, it was important for us to make every byte count.
										First, the image is reduced from 640px x 480px to 100px x 67px before being sent to the website.
										The quality of the image is greatly reduced, but we get better framerates and smoothness in the end.
										<br/><br/>
										The webpage where the video feed is displayed is simple. It contains the video stream,
										with buttons overlayed to control the webcam orientation.
										When a button is pressed, a XHR request is sent to the listener script running on the Raspberry Pi.
										The keyboard arrow keys also call on these same requests.
										<br/><br/>
										The listener script then translates this requests to serial commands to send to the arduino.
										The listener script is also a Flask application. There is a text box also on the website,
										where the user can submit text that is to be spoken on the speaker.
										The text is transferred over an XHR request as well to the same listener script running on the Pi.
										The listener script then uses the pyttsx text to speech engine to output the speech from the Pi’s audio jack.
