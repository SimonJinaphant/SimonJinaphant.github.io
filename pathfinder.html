									My summer project for 2014: a visually interactive android application where users can create their own maze

									Pathfinding algorithms are popularly used in AI for video games and robotics, 
									they navigate an entity through an obstacle filled environment within optimal time. 
									Throughout the development stages of this application I have also attained a firm understanding and appreciation 
									for the logic behind these pathfinding algorithms.

								<p>
									Computing a solution for a maze can be achieved with a simple brute force algorithm such as a flood-fill, 
									however this is not the best approach when we can estimate how far we are from our goal position.
									<br/><br/>
									I self-taught myself programming by breaking down open source projects and studying the internal mechanism of it. 
									Most of the projects I stumbled upon were intended for video games, and the problem of traversing from Point A to 
									Point B without running into an obstacle was a common theme.

									One popular solution is A*, a heuristic based search algorithm which incorporates the 
									fundamentals of Dijkstra and Best First Search in order to compute the shortest path with minimal search time.

								<p>
									Best First Search is sometimes considered a “greedy” algorithm; it utilizes heuristic, 
									a technique for estimating the distance between two position, 
									to speed up the search by prioritizing certain elements for analysis.
									<br/><br/>
									When Best First Search's estimation is integrated with Dijkstra, where each element is assigned a cost in order to 
									quantify which path is more expensive than another: an effective search algorithm is created.

								<p>
									I originally started the project in Python because it was easier to build a working prototype. 
									I studied A* from various online resources including it's original research paper, 
									but spent countless hours debugging by stepping through the code during runtime; 
									although it was repetitive and exhausting, this experience has given me a deeper understanding 
									and appreciation for pathfinding algorithms.
									<br/><br/>
									Midway through the development process I noticed how the algorithm’s performance was lacking, 
									originally I thought it was Python being slow, but further investigation led me 
									to conclude that it was my lack of an optimized data structure.
									<br/><br/>
									A* needs to prioritize certain elements, but storing these elements while keeping track of priority was tricky. 
									A naive attempt is to dump the elements in a list and search for the best one every time; 
									this obviously had tremendous consequences for the performance once the list gets enormous.
									Sorting the list everytime an element was added or removed also wasn’t going to be helpful because only 
									a small partition would ever need to be reordered.
									<br/><br/>
									To solve this problem I had to use a Priority Queue -also known as a binary heap depending on its implementation- 
									where elements are stored relative to their priority. The most favoured elements were located the front -or root, 
									whereas the least are near the back -or leaf. Removing the root element is as easy as swapping it with a leaf node and popping it. 
									Insertion was also simple as the heap only had to operate on certain sub-heaps. 
									This implementation had greatly increase  my A* calculation speed by a factor of 3x at minimum!

								<p>
									By the time the pathfinding was fully operational, my summer was approaching the end 
									and I was starting my first year of university within a couple of weeks. 
									Telling people that I could do pathfinding is impressive, but not as impressive as being able to demonstrate it in front of them. 
									<br/><br/>
									I took this opportunity -in addition to the fact that I got my first smartphone around this time too- 
									to learn a fair amount of the Android framework in order to create an graphical display for interacting with the pathfinder; 
									I also had to port all of my previous code to Java, but it was not a concern as I also had previous experience developing with Java.
									<br/><br/>
									By September I had my summer project loaded onto my phone, I could simply take it out my pocket and leave some people in awe, 
									particularly those who don’t know much about programming; this also made my transition into university easier as 
									I would commonly demonstrate my app to get a conversation started when meeting new people, its a great ice-breaker!

								<p>
									This opportunity has also led me into studying more pathfinding algorithms; while A* is a good candidate for finding the shortest path, 
									it has its limitations. Different variations of pathfinding algorithms have been developed with new ones constantly being created every year; 
									these variations includes features such as pre-processing, angular movement, and even faster re-calculation for changing obstacles.
									<br/><br/>
									I have managed to implement a couple of these variations over at <a href="snowbots">UBC Snowbots</a>, 
									where my pathfinding work is being applied to autonomously navigate real-life robots!
