									<br/>
									To give engineering students hand’s on experience, first years taking APSC 150 must work in a team to
									design, construct, and present a projectile launcher. Due to the evolving nature of this course, 
									students enrolled in the second term of the 2014 winter sessions were specifically required 
									to have their launcher shoot the payloads into four different targets.
									<br/><br/>
									Students are divided into groups of eight, and were given <i>almost</i> free creativity over the design of their launchers, 
									which they must deliver over the next five weeks. Each groups were expected to design two launchers and pick one for 
									competition based on their preference from testing.

								<p>
									The main requirements for the launcher included a joystick, linked to an Arduino, which must be used to control a maximum of three servos; 
									these servos can control the launcher’s pitch and yaw angle, along with the triggering mechanism to shoot the payload.
									<br/><br/>
									The circuitry for controlling the servos, along with the software, were given and allowed to be modified.

								<p>
									In my group, I was responsible for understanding the circuitry and software, 
									along with adjusting them to allow more flexibility in our design options.
									<br/><br/>
									During the design weeks many teams had to work outside of the given lab time; 
									I also had to ensure participation and cooperation between my fellow team members by managing team 
									communication and establishing meetings outside of class time.

								<p>
									Together with my group, we proposed our two design models and divided into smaller groups of four to begin our work. 
									<br/><br/>
									The first proposed design, uses all of the three servos provided in order to control the trigger, pitch, and yaw angles. 
									<br/><br/>
									This launcher was codename <i>Limitless</i>, due to its restriction-free controls.
								</p>

							<article class="6u 12u$(xsmall) work-item">
								<p>							
									The second launcher, which I worked on, was designed to be unique compared to the rest.
									<br/><br/>
									Instead of using all three servos to have complete control, we physically restricted the pitch angle of the launcher 
									and only used two servos to trigger and adjust the yaw angle. 
									<br/><br/>
									To complement the first design’s codename, I suggested to name this launcher <i>Limited Edition</i>.

								<h4>A sample design schematic for <i>Limited Edition</i></h4>
							</article>
							
							<article class="12u$ 12u$(xsmall) work-item">
								<p>
									In order to have <i>Limited Edition</i> be capable of shooting into all four targets, we needed a new way of adjusting the launcher’s firing range. 
									Since we cannot adjust the pitch angle we were forced to adjust the tension from the rubber bands. 
									The design for this included a <i>“tension selector”</i> which essentially provided a way to hook the rubber band in 
									three different places for different tension strength.

								<h4>The resulting launchers: <i>Limited Edition</i> on the left, and <i>Limitless</i> on the right</h4>
								<p>
									<br/>
									For the competition we selected <i>Limitless</i> over <i>Limited Edition</i>, the prime reason was due to the reloading speed. 
									While <i>Limited Edition</i> provided a unique way to launch the payload, reloading it via the tension selector was difficult and time consuming. 
									<br/><br/>
									Our choice to focus on reloading speed eventually paid off during competition when we scored 4 out of 8 points which 
									ranked us amongst the top teams, whereas many other teams had difficulties reloading, making them run out of time.
